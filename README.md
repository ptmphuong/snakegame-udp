# snake_game_udp

* Server main: Server class
* Player 1 (start game): Client1 class
* Player 2 (join game): Client2 class

Game speed can be edited in Config class. The current game speed is slower so that I could test on 2 computers by myself. 

To set up client, server port and ip, please change in the Config file. Thanks!
